Fake Instagram web app

## Now, what is this?

Finstagram, a web application for sharing photos. Just like instagram, but only more secure with enhanced features.

Finstagram gives users more privacy than many photo sharing sites by giving them more detailed control over who can see which photos they post. 

The focus of the project was to manage the database activity and its interaction with the backend. The app can succesfuly manage the requests so that user can have smooth experience with enhanced features.

A user can:
- have an account and log in
- post photos
- view photos they are authorized to view (public photos, photos posted by people they are `following`, and "close friends" groups)
- form user groups ("close friend groups") and post a picture that only people in that group can view
- make the posts 'public' so any user following them can see the posts
- follow other users and see their public posts if they accept the follow request
- accept/reject/ignore follow requests
- send tag requests to other users to tag them in a post
- accept/reject/ignore tag requests
- comment on pictures they are able to view


## How do I run it?
Go to the directory where the app.py is using your terminal, and run `python app.py`
