Fake Instagram web app using databases

## what?
This is a project I did for my database class.

Finstagram, a web application for sharing photos.

Finstagram gives users more privacy than many photo sharing sites by giving them more
detailed control over who can see which photos they post. The focus of the project is on
storing data about who posted which photos and who has permission to view them, tag others
in them, see whoâ€™s tagged in what, etc.

Users are able to log in, post photos, view (some of) the photos posted by others (public
photos, photos posted by people they are `following`, and close friends, detailed below); `tag`
photos items with handles of people, etc. 

## how?
Go to the directory where the app.py is using your terminal, and run `python app.py`
